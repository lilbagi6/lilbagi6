### Hi there 👋

My name is **Bogdan**, and I’m an aspiring data scientist passionate about machine learning, Python, and data analysis. I enjoy solving problems, learn more about AI, universe, technologies, science, participating in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/your_profile) competitions, and training models and neurons daily 

---

### 💼 What I'm working on:
- 🧠 Learning more about machine learning and deep learning
- 🐍 Writing Python code using pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, tensorflow and more
- 📊 Exploring data and visualizing insights
- 🎯 Joining Kaggle competitions and personal projects

---

### 🔍 Future Projects:
I'm currently collecting astronomical data and working on the following deep learning projects:

- 🌌 **Galaxy Morphology Classification (Hubble Types)**  
  Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify galaxies into spiral, elliptical, irregular, and other types based on telescope images.

- 🔭 **Gravitational Lens Detection**  
  Using CNNs to detect gravitational lensing effects — distortions of light caused by massive celestial objects like galaxies or black holes.

- ✨ **Supernova Detection in Sky Surveys**  
  Developing a model to automatically identify supernovae by comparing pre- and post-event space images.
